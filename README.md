Find out when the bus is coming

I thought it would be cool to ask my voice assistant when the next bus would pass in front of my building. 
This just parses the Nextbus website, then do some slight adjustments to get a timestamp and voil√†.

The transportation agency in San Francisco is called MUNI, and the line was the 36. That's why this project is called muni36 :)
